    "Three significant events triggered the current growth in the use of analytical devision making and *Statistics is central to all of them*.\n",

    "The objective of modern statistics is to interpret data received *as is*.\n",

    "We must create impactfull data visualization.\n",

    "### Clasification\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Clasification* techniques helps in segmenting the customers into appropiate groups on key characteristics(sentiment, money spent, time of patronage, etc).\n",
    "- Classification helps professionals understand the customer behavior and position their products and brands using appropiate strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pattern recognition techniques helps us to reveal hidden patterns or *data forms* in the data set that could be everaged by retail professionals. Pattern recognition techniques include *Histogram, Box Plot, Scatter Plot* and other *Visual Analytics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between variables. *Association Analysis* helps in determining the correlation  between variabbles, this relationship may not always be perfectly clear, so we go for stating the *probability* of something being related. For example, market basket analysis may lead to a finding that if customers buy coffee, there is a __40% probability__ that they also buy bread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and targeting the most profitable customers can be facilitated by predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression can be used for predicting the amount of expenditure on a particular product based on input variables(income, age, gender, etc.).Organizations can leverage on other advanced models that comprise *Logistic regression*, and *Neural Networks* for predicting a target variable as well as classifying and predicting into which group the consumer belongs to. For example, these models can classify and predict buyers and non-buyers."
