    "#### Five Number Summary and The Boxplot\n",
    "*The Boxplot*[<sup>4</sup>](#fn4) is a graphical display of the data based on the five-number summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/boxplots.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot sows us the central tendency of the data, teh dispersion of the data and the skewness of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If data are symmetric around the median, then the box and central line are centered between the endpoints, it can also be shown in either a vertical or horixontal orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/symmetric_boxplot.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distribution Shape and The Boxplot\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/skewed_boxplots.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is very skewed, then the boxplot will tend to extend itself with a very long whisker on one side, this is most likely not representative of the data, so the boxplot is sometimes reshaped to stop at a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./media/boxplot_with_outlier.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>This boxplot shows an outlier value of 27 plotted separately.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A value is considered an outlier if it is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range below $Q_{1}$ or above $Q_{3}$. This means that the boxplot can also be used to show outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Histograms Often Tell More than Boxplots\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./media/bymodal_distribution.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Bymodal distribution histogram.</figcaption>\n",

    "    <img src=\"./media/unimodal_distribution.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Unimodal distribution histogram.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "This two histograms have the same boxplot representation. They have the same values for $X_{min}$, $Q_{1}$, $median$, $Q_{3}$ and $X_{max}$. However, they have very different data distributions. So, in this case, using a boxplot would loose the information on the mode, and a histogram is much better suited for this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good desciptive statistics often involves looking at multiple graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantile Plot\n",
    "A quantile plot displaus all of the data as fi it were equally soaced, allowing the user to asses voth the overall behaviou and unusial occurrences. It plots **quantile** information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data $x_{i}$ data sorted in increasing order, $f_{i}$ indicates that approximately $100f_{i}\\%$ of the data are below or equal to the value $x_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./media/quantile_plot.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Quantile Plot.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "What sets a quantile plot apart from a boxplot is that it displays all percentages(or *all quantiles*), instead of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% as the boxplot does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot\n",
    "If we encounter outliers or there is a shift in the distribution, then the quantile plots of the two distributions will look diferent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./media/quantile_quantile_plot.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Quantile-Quantile Plot.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graph, we can see the quantile plots of branch1 and branch two. The fact that they do not line up perfectly with a $45\\degree$ line indicates that the two distributions are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can also help us compare our data with other ditribution models(like a bell curve), and figure out if our data is consistent with such distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the QQ Plot is a way forus to look at comparatives of different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scatter plot\n",
    "The scatter plot is a different way to look at two variables, here we plot the two vriables(or features) in two different axis; if our data has two variables, then it is known as *bivariate data*, which means that instead of observing one characteristic in an observation, we're observing two characteristics in every observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./media/scatter_plot.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Scatter plot with \"Unit price\" and \"Items sold\" variables.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pair of vaues can be treated as a coordinate in a plot(if our data is bivariate). In the plot above, we can see the relationship between items sold and unit price as a picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positively and Negatively Correlated Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlatin is the idea thatas one variable increases, the other variable increases with it or decreases(variables moving in the same direction or in opposite directions). \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./media/positive_correlation.png\" maxHeight=400 maxWidth=400/>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Positive correlation scatter plot.</figcaption>\n",

    "    <figcaption>Uncorrelated data scatter plots.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this plots show uncorrelated data, even the opnes with large blank spaces, the spaces are just artifacts of the way the data is plotted, this may look like a pattern, but it is caused by the way the graph is layed out and not by data correlation, as it should be. Always be careful to prevent false pictures of asociation."
