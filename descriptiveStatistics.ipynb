    "A *histogram* (also known as a frequency histogram) is a snapshot of the frequency distribution. It's a graphical representation of the frequency distribution in which the X-axis represents the classes and the Y-axis represents the frequencies in bars.The histogram depicts the pattern of the distribution emerging fron the characterisic being measured.\n",

    "### What is central tendency?\n",
    "Whenever we measure things of the same kind, a fairly large number of such measurements will tend to cluster around the middle value. Such a value is called a measure of *\"Central Tendency\"*[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2).\n",

    "The Median is the *middle most observation* when you arrange data in *ascending order of magnitude*. Median is such taht 50% of the observations are above the median, and 50% of the observations are below the median.\n",
    "\n",

    "Once we have a notion of what the central tendency is(measured however we choose to). The next challenge is to figure out how is the data distributed around the central tendency.\n",

    "\n",
    "The *IQR* is the Range computed on middle 50% of the observations after eliminating the highest and lowest 25% of observations ina ddata set that is arranged in ascending order, in consequence, the IQR is less affected by outliers.\n",
